In each case, the hasPart / isPartOf properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\n\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group.
