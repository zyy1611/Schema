(Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.\nNote that both RDFa and Microdata syntax allow the use of a \"content=\" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.\nUse values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.\n\n",
